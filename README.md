# Interfacial Cavitation with Surface Tension

This repository contains the code base for the finite element implementation of the elasto-capillarity problem I developed for modeling the interfacial cavitation with surface tension.

Specifically, the repository include the python script to generate mesh "CAVA_MESH.py" and to run the finite simulation "CAVA_run.py". Users are supposed to run "CAVA_MESH.py" at first and then run "CAVA_run.py".
